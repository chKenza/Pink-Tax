Inspiration
Perfume notes: let the model predict perfume notes.

Department prediction: build a model to decide the perfume department based on the notes features

Price prediction: predict the prices of the products based on the num_seller_ratings and other features

Brand prediction: it seems that some brands have a favorite note, lets the machine guess the brand based on the notes features

Concentration prediction: it seems that some concentration has a common note, lets the machine guess the concentration based on the notes features

Feature Engineering: do magic and play around to create new features from this dataset
